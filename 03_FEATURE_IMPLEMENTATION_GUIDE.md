### Implementation Notes
- GPS positions are **high-volume time-series data** — consider TimescaleDB or table partitioning
- Protocol decoders run on Netty (Java) — may need a sidecar service or Node.js port
- WebSocket required for real-time map updates
- Device permissions follow user→device many-to-many pattern (from Traccar)
